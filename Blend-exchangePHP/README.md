Blend-Exchange
==============

This is a project to add long term (sort of permanent) blend hosting for https://blender.stackexchange.com/ until we can convince the SE lords to add the feature :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## Idea
Users can upload a file into a repo here on github or any free filestorage system that can be accessed publicly from the web and written to programatically

The users will be required to include a question link in order to insure it is only used for BSE questions, since space is valuable.

In an HTTP header often the site that the link was clicked on his provided... if more references come from not BSE or not the question, it can be reviewed, automating abuse control.
